This is a four-part course where we're going to learn how to build lists fast, what to send, and how to make our email marketing data-driven.

## Lesson 1: Email Marketing Basics: The Good, the Bad & the WOW!

### Lesson 1: Objectives

1. Maximise our email marketing by avoiding the spam folder.
2. Optimise our content for all devices and accessibility settings
3. Improve engagement by using pre-headers in subject lines.
4. Know the law to make sure that you stay compliant in today's privacy-focused world.

### It's 2020 - Does Email Marketing Still Work?

The answer is a resounding yes!

Email can send direct:

* At a time that's most relevant to the recipient
* With personalised content or product offers
* ... and track individual recipient engagement
* ... and automate your follow up!

Email gets read:

* The average email read rate is 25-30% compared with 2% on social media. This is a huge difference.

In fact, according to a survey by [Adobe](https://theblog.adobe.com/love-email-but-spreading-the-love-other-channels/) in 2018, consumers prefer to get offers from brands by email because they can read it when they're ready.

Here's the main reason that marketers still love email marketing though:

### The Anatomy of an Email

1. Subject line (can be responsible for as much as 40% of open-rate).
2. Pre-header (shows up as preview text in your inbox).
3. Branded graphic header (300px wide for mobile).
4. Main message.
5. Call-to-Action.
6. Supporting Message.
7. Footer (for the legals).

2. **The Bad:** (5 things to never do).
3. **The WOW:** (examples of campaigns that really worked).

### **The Good:** 5 things to always do

Did you know that the emails that you send might not end up being delivered to your recipients at all ðŸ˜®? It could end up in their spam folder or just plain disappear into the ether.

Marketing emails are subject to a concept known as deliverability so if Gmail thinks your email looks spammy, they won't deliver it. Not only that, but they won't report this back to you either so your open rate will nosedive and your spam score will skyrocket.

How reputable are you? The more your recipients think that you're reputable, the more likely you are to see that mythical 100% inbox placement. So you want to take care of your reputation and that starts with getting your subscribers' permission, setting expectations about when and how often they'll receive email from you, and then playing by these rules.

**1. Get Permission**

* Subscribers should opt-in
* Set expectations on frequency, value, security

**2. Follow the law - UK & GDPR**

* Identify who you are
* Give the person the ability to opt out of (or â€˜unsubscribe fromâ€™) further emails.
* The intent of the email must be apparent from the subject line and message body
* State how data will be used in privacy policy
* Host and transfer data responsibly
* Explicit permission and proof required

**3. Have a content marketing plan**

You should have a content marketing calendar, which incorporates emails, but also aligns with all your other content marketing channels. You also want to make sure that that plan is aligned with your goals and KPIs - define your metrics for success.

**4. Have a testing plan**

Make sure you set your metrics up front. Do you want to drive opens or do you want to drive conversions?

You can test just about anything:

* Subject lines
* Day of the week
* Frequency
* Personalisation
* Discount/price

**5. Use email's secret weapon: data**

Data drives:

* **Personalisation:** Tailoring content by adding a recipient's first name.
* **Segmentation:** Those who get an offer versus those who don't.
* **Automation:** Drip-fed content that's delivered automatically.
* **Optimisation:** Testing allows you to find and then double-down on the right campaigns.

### **The Bad:** 5 things to never do

**1. Don't start from scratch**

Don't sit down once a month and try to write a bunch of emails. Repurpose and include content from your blog, your social channels,and especially videos as they do really well in email.

**2. Don't use one big image... or a bunch of small ones**

If images are turned off, and they are by default in Outlook and some versions of Android, your audience aren't going to see your copy or your CTAs.

**3. Don't buy an email list**

It's 2020, it's done. Under CCPA legislation, the people selling you the list are probable doing so illegally anyway. Don't do it! If you want to grow your list quickly consider investing in:

* Media: Sponsored emails etc
* SEO/Inbound lead generation
* Email sign-up promotions
* In-store/in-air sign-up scripts and contests

**4. Don't forget mobile**

The majority of B2C emails are opened on a mobile device so you really need to adopt a mobile-first approach to your email design if this is how you do business. This is not as true for B2B emails but it's easy to design mobile-first so there's no reason why it shouldn't be implemented for B2B also.

**5. Don't send without a pre-flight check**

Make sure your email looks acceptable across the range of devices and inboxes before you send it.



### **WOW, THAT ROCKED!**

* **Pre-headers can sell:** Subject line and pre-header working well together will boost open rates
* **Video:** Video and animation can lift pretty significantly in email.
* **Tell stories:** Don't just sell!
* **Give your fans a megaphone:** Make sure that you are not the only one saying how great you are, referral programs are powerful!
