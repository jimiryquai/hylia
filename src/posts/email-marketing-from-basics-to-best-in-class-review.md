This is a four-part course where we're going to learn how to build lists fast, what to send, and how to make our email marketing data-driven.

## Lesson 1: Email Marketing Basics: The Good, the Bad & the WOW!

### Lesson 1: Objectives

1. Maximise our email marketing by avoiding the spam folder.
2. Optimise our content for all devices and accessibility settings
3. Improve engagement by using pre-headers in subject lines.
4. Know the law to make sure that you stay compliant in today's privacy-focused world.

### It's 2020 - Does Email Marketing Still Work?

The answer is a resounding yes!

Email can send direct:

* At a time that's most relevant to the recipient
* With personalised content or product offers
* ... and track individual recipient engagement
* ... and automate your follow up!

Email gets read:

* The average email read rate is 25-30% compared with 2% on social media. This is a huge difference.

In fact, according to a survey by [Adobe](https://theblog.adobe.com/love-email-but-spreading-the-love-other-channels/) in 2018, consumers prefer to get offers from brands by email because they can read it when they're ready.

1. **The Good:** (5 things to always do).
2. **The Bad:** (5 things to never do).
3. **The WOW:** (examples of campaigns that really worked).

### **The Good**

Did you know that the emails that you send might not end up being delivered to your recipients at all ðŸ˜®? It could end up in their spam folder or just plain disappear into the ether. 

If Gmail thinks your email looks spammy, they won't deliver it and they won't report this back to you either so your open rate will nosedive and your spam score will skyrocket.

How reputable are you? What do people say about you? The more your recipients think that you're reputable, the more likely you are to see that mythical 100% inbox placement. So you want to take care of your reputation and that starts with getting your subscribers' permission, setting expectations about when and how often they'll receive email from you and then playing by these rules.
