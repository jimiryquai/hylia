I've been taking part in beta-testing the the Web Developer track of the Practicum by Yandex educational platform since 3rd February 2020 and I consider myself exceptionally fortunate to be a part of it. I'm part of the Lime group and, so far, we've completed 5 amazing projects for our portfolios. 

For our latest project we were split into pairs and asked to code the front-end of a simple 2-3 page app using HTML, CSS and JS. There was a choice of four different app projects that you could request to be a part of :

* üöó Car eCommerce
* üçî Food eCommerce
* üé• Movie reviews
* üéµ Music streaming

 I ‚ù§Ô∏è music so I wanted to be a part of the music streaming app team and I managed to get myself assigned to Beethoven group along with the super-talented Jayme Waye üéâ. Here's the link to the Figma design file that we were tasked with turning into a prototype:

Every day is a school day and this is what helps me get out of bed in the morning. I ‚ù§Ô∏è learning and the feeling of being pushed outside of your comfort zone and this week I learned some things that I feel it's worth making a record of:

1. How to style a HTML progress bar
2. How to loop through an array in JavaScript and apply a CSS class to some items whilst excluding others
3. How to collaborate on code in GitHub, set up a pull request and review somebody else's code



## How to style a HTML progress bar

You can also add videos to posts from YouTube or Vimeo (or wherever, really) and the front-end will also make those bleed-out for you too.

Finally, how about a `<blockquote>`?

> Quotes will take a slightly different style to normal body text and look fancy.

Hopefully, this has demonstrated how simple it is to make a nice looking blog with Hylia.
