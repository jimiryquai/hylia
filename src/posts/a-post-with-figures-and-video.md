I've been taking part in beta-testing the the Web Developer track of the Practicum by Yandex educational platform since 3rd February 2020 and I consider myself exceptionally fortunate to be a part of it. I'm part of the Lime group and, so far, we've completed 5 amazing projects for our portfolios. 

For our latest project we were split into pairs and asked to code the front-end of a simple 2-3 page app using HTML, CSS and JS. There was a choice of four different app projects that you could request to be a part of :

* 🚗 Car eCommerce
* 🍔 Food eCommerce
* 🎥 Movie reviews
* 🎵 Music streaming

I wanted to build the music streaming app and I managed to get myself assigned to Beethoven team along with the super-talented Jayme Waye 🎉. Here's the link to the Figma design file that we were tasked with turning into a prototype:

Every day is a school day 🎓 and this is what helps me get out of bed in the morning. I ❤️ learning and the feeling of being pushed outside of your comfort zone and this week I learned some things that I feel it's worth making a record of:

1. How to style a HTML progress bar
2. How to loop through an array in JavaScript and apply a CSS class to some items whilst excluding others
3. How to collaborate on code in GitHub, set up a pull request and review somebody else's code

## How to style a HTML progress bar

If you check out the design file linked above, you'll see that the first or home screen of the app looks quite a bit more complicated to design/code that the second or player screen. I gave Jayme the chance to specify which screen she'd like to code and she said she didn't have a preference so I instantly reverted to type and chose what I felt would be the easier option - the player screen 👇 (sorry Jayme 🤭).

The progress bar was the only unknown entity to me on this screen and I imagined it had been included as part of the design as the mentors knew it would be a bit of a pain in the ass to style.

As with most things in life, particularly web/software dev, it's always easier to stand on the shoulders of giants and so I turned to the #1 skill of the modern developer - I Googled it 😂. I came across this super-comprehensive article by Pankaj Parasar on CSS-TRICKS:
