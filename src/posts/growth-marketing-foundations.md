### Building a growth process

The most common framework for a growth model is generally Dave McClure's üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Pirate Metrics for startups, which is the AARRR framework. So, you've got:

* Acquisition
* Activation
* Retention
* Revenue
* Referrals

I think something that's really important to note here is going through the exercise of mapping the customer journey and doing it from the perspective of the customer is really, really valuable. 

Rather than just looking at your growth model through the lens of "How can I increase value to my business?" thinking about, "How I can increase the value we are delivering to our customers?" puts you in a much better position to come up with the right hypotheses to test and the right experiments to run to improve conversion.The worst way to come up with experiments is to focus on your growth metrics themselves, rather than solving customer pain points that then lead to increased performance. So, if you want to, say, increase activation rate of new visitors to your site, you shouldn't start with,"Oh, I want to do this thing to convince this person to buy something," 'cause your customers don't see their experience of visiting your website through the lens of what you want them to do.

You should think about how you can actually improve their experience,and make it more likely that they buy something, and have a better experience doing so. So if you want to increase activation rate, or first-time purchases on your website, think about how you can reduce barriers for the customer, and make their experience better, so that in the end they make that purchase. But you're focused on actually making the experience better for them.

It's a good practice to do this once a quarter or at least twice a year. It's also a good practice to map out the ideal customer journey or golden path for each channel of acquisition - organic, referral Facebook etc as each journey and phase of awareness will be slightly different.

# Defining your growth model

Setting goals aligned with the context of where the customer is during their, in their life-cycle, helps you also design programs, campaigns, and experiments based on who that customer likely is, how much they know about your brand, how much have they interacted with you in the past, and what actions have they taken. So that way you can line up all of your different experiments against these different key high level metrics in your growth model.

# Quarterly growth planning

How do we plan for plan for quarterly growth? By prioritising the most impactful metrics and identifying the biggest opportunities.

The first step in coming up with a good quarterly plan is to explore your data and identify the biggest pain points for your customers, 'cause that's what you should be solving for. These are your biggest areas of opportunity and you use them to set your goals.

What are the steps that your customer takes on their journey from discovering your product or service all the way through to becoming a repeat customer or raving fan?

Where are the biggest areas of opportunity in your current funnel? At which point(s) are the most customers dropping off?

So obviously your quarterly goals, or OKRs, should tie in with your overall company OKRs or objectives and key results.

# Identifying quarterly goals

### How to achieve company goals by using small teams focused on boosting specific metrics over a three-month period.

Growth teams are generally split between the acquisition side and the engagement side. Acquisitions come from SEO, SEM and paid advertising, and this team generally uses different channels and has a a different expertise than a team that's focused on engagement, retention, revenue and referrals 

So generally, it's good to set different goals for each teams, and then pick a specific funnel metric that you want to focus on, and do everything you can to really fine tune it. Narrowing in focus can really help you get into the mindset of a specific type of customer at a specific point in their journey choose the high level funnel metric part of your growth model to work towards,say it's activation rate,and then you want to look for all of the different inputs that affect the activation rate,so this is where you kind of get into the channels,and I think this is where you get into the road mapping process.

# How to effectively brainstorm

The focus for the session should not be a mile wide and an inch deep - quite the opposite. Get really focused on a specific metric and then go deep on that.

Have somebody from your team walk through the customer journey for everybody else to understand what it currently looks like for someone who is doing it for the first time.

# Prioritizing

The ICE framework: impact, confidence, and effort.

## In-quarter execution

The build, measure, learn cycle.

There are kind of four steps in the process. The first is designing your experiment. Then you ship your experiment. You analyze the results. And then, if it works, you automate it and you scale it. If it doesn't work, you take that learning to inform your next task. And then you just keep going through that cycle as quickly as possible.
