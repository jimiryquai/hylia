This week was my first week of studying the Growth Marketing mini-degree program at CXL. The introductory track, growth marketing foundations, explores the definition of growth marketing, how it differs from conventional marketing, and how to get started with it.

## Building a growth process

There are three phases of growth management: 

* high-level strategy
* quarterly planning
* in-quarter execution

### High-level Strategy

The most common framework for a growth model is generally Dave McClure's 🏴‍☠️ Pirate Metrics for startups, which is the AARRR framework. So, you've got:

* Acquisition
* Activation
* Retention
* Revenue
* Referrals

Essentially, this is a model of your funnel and, once you have this model in place, the next step is to map out the customer journey. What is it like for them to proceed through this funnel in its entirety?

Next, identify all of the channels where you can reach your customers at each stage in the funnel. For acquisition this could be SEO and SEM and for activation this could be email marketing or push notifications.

The important thing to note here is that this process should focus on solving customer pain points and increasing the value that you're delivering to your customers. This puts you in a much better position to come up with the right hypotheses to test and the right experiments to run to improve conversion. Don't focus on your growth metrics themselves, focus on making the experience better for the customer.

It's a good practice to do this once a quarter or at least twice a year. It's also a good practice to map out the ideal customer journey, or golden path, for each channel of acquisition - organic, referral social etc as each journey will be slightly different.

## Defining your growth model

There are many different growth metrics that you can use to better understand and drive growth in your business. Setting goals aligned with the context of what stage the customer is at in their journey helps you design campaigns, and experiments based on who that customer likely is, how much they know about your brand, how much have they interacted with you in the past, and what actions have they taken. So that way you can line up all of your different experiments against these different key high level metrics in your growth model.

## Quarterly planning

How do we plan for plan for quarterly growth? By prioritising the most impactful metrics and identifying the biggest opportunities.

The first step in coming up with a good quarterly plan is to explore your data and identify the biggest pain points for your customers. These are your biggest areas of opportunity and you should use them to set your goals.

What are the steps that your customer takes on their journey from discovering your product or service all the way through to becoming a repeat customer or raving fan?

Where are the biggest areas of opportunity in your current funnel? At which point(s) are the most customers dropping off?

So obviously your quarterly goals, or OKRs (objectives and key results), should tie in with your overall company OKRs.

Your objective is a high-level qualitative goal, such as increasing activations, and the key result is the quantifiable metric that determines whether or not you have succeeded in achieving your goal.

You want goals that are motivating, ambitious,and that make people feel good when they achieve them. But you also want them to be achievable. A good way to strike a balance between ambition and achievability is to set baseline goals and stretch goals. A baseline goal should still push you, but you should be able to achieve it roughly 70 - 80% of the time. Having a stretch goal, probably one quarter a year, is a great way to give your team something really ambitious to go after.

# Identifying quarterly goals

Growth teams are generally split between the acquisition side and the engagement side. Acquisitions come from SEO, SEM and paid advertising, and this team generally uses different channels and has a a different expertise than a team that's focused on engagement, retention, revenue and referrals 

So generally, it's good to set different goals for each teams, and then pick a specific funnel metric that you want to focus on, and do everything you can to really fine tune it. Narrowing in focus can really help you get into the mindset of a specific type of customer at a specific point in their journey. 

Say you choose to focus on activation rate - try to improve that metric bit-by-bit, week-on-week, and by the end of the quarter you should have significantly improved that metric.

Once you start feeling like you've hit the point of diminishing returns, you can move onto the next metric and focus on a different area of growth. 

Or you can brainstorm totally new ways to improve that same metric - come up with totally new ideas.

## How to effectively brainstorm

The focus for the session should not be a mile wide and an inch deep - quite the opposite. Get really focused on a specific metric and then go deep on that.

Have somebody from your team walk through the customer journey for everybody else to understand what it currently looks like for someone who is doing it for the first time.

Don't just throw out random ideas - your ideas should be framed in the form of a hypothesis. For instance:

> By doing `x`,we are going to see `y` improvement in this metric for this reason

Framing your ideas like this ensures ensures that you're formulating logical experiments that are testable and rooted in data or research that you have done.

For brainstorming to be effective, you want to limit the focus to specific goals or metrics but you don't want to limit the ideas themselves. Get creative and focus on maximizing the amount of ideas that you get down on paper. Prioritisation and making sure you're actually focusing on the highest impact things comes next.

## Prioritising

What you want to do here is come up with some sort of concept on your predicted return on investment. The ICE framework is a helpful tool in that regard:

**Impact:** Roughly estimate the impact of the experiment using some sort of like rating scale, say 1 to 5, based on the size of the audience.

**Confidence:** Confidence generally just improves with running more experiments and getting more data a bout what tends to work and what doesn't.

**Effort:** How much time, energy and resources are going to go into shipping this experiment and getting it in front of customers?

In general we want high numbers for impact and confidence and a lower number for effort to execute.

## **In-quarter execution**

There are kind of four steps in the process. The first is designing your experiment. Then you ship your experiment. You analyze the results. And then, if it works, you automate it and you scale it. If it doesn't work, you take that learning to inform your next task. And then you just keep going through that cycle as quickly as possible.
