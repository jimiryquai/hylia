I recently had a requirement for Field Service Engineers to be able to save multiple photos captured from the camera control in a Canvas App to the SharePoint Document Location associated with the Job record that they are working on - thereby giving the Administrators in the office full visibility of the photos from within the Model-Driven App that they use for scheduling the Jobs.

In order to achieve this I needed to configure:

1. The Model-Driven App; and
2. The Canvas App; and
3. A Power Automate Flow.

## The Model-Driven App

In terms of the Model-Driven app I needed to do two things:

1. Set the default document management settings via [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments) > Your Environment > Settings > Integration > Document management settings:

1. Add a related Documents Subgrid to the Main form of the Jobs table:

A good friend of mine [Rob Nightingale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-nightingale-bba8a89/) once told me (ok - I needed telling more than once ðŸ¤£) that you should always execute a process manually **before** trying to automate it so that's what I did next. I uploaded an image to the **Documents on Default Site 1** Document Location and found that, within SharePoint, the image had been stored inside a folder that had been named with the following convention: **Name_RowId**:
