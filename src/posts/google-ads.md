Learn the big pig picture of Google Ads through Search, Shopping, Display, and Video. Most importantly, learn how to use the Google Ads platform to make a return on your investment.

This course will teach you how to:

* Set the strongest Google Ads foundation that requires the least amount of oversight
* Prove that an ROI is being made via conversion tracking and attribution
* The recipes needed to be successful with every new ad group and campaign you launch
* How to scale different channels within Google Ads for any marketing goal you have

## Meaningful Metrics

When you're getting started with the Google Ads platform, you’ll be presented with an overwhelming amount of metrics within your account. Which metrics are important and which metrics should be sacrificed if you want to achieve your goals?

If you want to make money through Google Ads, your ROI, your profit, your profit margin, and your volume of sales are the most important metrics. After that comes the cost per conversion, the conversion volume, and the return on ad spend. Lastly, all the other micro-metrics like, click-through rate, quality score, impressions share, and things like that.

You can't optimise all of these metrics at the same time so it's important that you prioritise the most meaningful metrics.

## More Accurate Goal Setting

When it comes to setting your goals, it's important understand all the things that are required for you to return a positive ROI.

Are you working with an agency? If so, their fee needs to be taken into consideration. Then you've got your:

* Average cost-per-click
* Conversion rate
* Close rate
* Average order value
* Lifetime customer value

Some of these metrics will be easier to establish than others - for instance if you're a relatively new business then lifetime value will be a relative unknown.

If you know your metrics then you can make more informed decisions as to the type of advertising that are suitable for your business. For instance, if your product has a low-profit margin which requires a high volume of traffic, but cost-per-click is expensive in your industry, you can quickly figure this out and make sure that you're not blind-sided.

## Understanding the Iceberg Effect

The quicker you learn what works and what doesn’t, the quicker you can become a profitable. Keep your campaign and ad group structure as simple as possible and you’ll be able to isolate what works and change what doesn't at a faster pace to achieve the numbers you want.

The Iceberg Effect refers to a situation where you've layered too many targeting options within your ad group or your ad set, and you're unable to assess the individual performance of those layers.

Use the least amount of layers in your targeting, and also keeping your individual targeting per campaign or ad group to an absolute minimum.

## Native Google Ads Research Tools

Google’shas more accurate data than any of the other "off-the-shelf" tools on the market. So take advantage!

Within your Google Ads account, you have two powerful research tools called the Keyword Planner and the Display Planner.

The keyword planner allows you to find brand new keywords when you're not sure of which one to target or bid on. These keyword ideas will become the root keywords for your Ad Groups set up that will come later on.

Another key feature is the ability to scan URLs from sites such as Reddit and Wikipedia for keyword analysis, and you can also use competitor URLs and then extract the keywords that the planner thinks that you should be bidding on.

The display planner is longer available as a stand alone tool and you will only be able to get the forecasting available within by creating a display campaign first.

While Google’s own tools are great, you can also use external tools to find new opportunities, audiences, and keywords three of these tools are:

* SpyFu
* SEMRush
* WhatRunsWhere

### Search & Shopping Temperatures

Many people are unaware that not all conversion intent is the same when it comes to Google Search. Savvy advertisers use the law of PPC temperatures to structure their campaigns to achieve higher levels of ROI.

The Search world consists of four pillars:

* Brand
* Competitor
* Generic
* Informational

Each type of search must be dealt with individually because they will all going perform differently from a conversion rate standpoint. So keep that in mind as you understand the different types of PPC temperatures. Yes,you can get any type of traffic to convert but you need to match up the intent and the temperature of the traffic with the temperature of the call to action.

## Display & YouTube Temperatures

Most people believe that Display and YouTube are just for brand awareness and impressions. Smart advertisers however have made Display and YouTube generate higher ROI than Search and Shopping.

It's important to have a multitude of call to actions and other offers ready, because performance can vary wildly when it comes to conversation intent. Think ebooks, or PDFs, or white papers -create a lot of variety within one type of offer and call to actionIn addition to that, you can also play around with something called smoke testing. Smoke testing is basically a minimum viable product, so to speak, of that call to action, which can help you get a gauge for what your visitors care about and where they're going to convert at a higher rate, which gives you the confidence to spend more time and resources to build out a much deeper ebook or a much deeper PDF, if that's what they actually want.

## Search & Shopping Targeting Options

When it comes to your targeting options within Search and Shopping, keep it as simple as possible. There are four types of keyword matching:

* Broad - a lot of waste spend can happen
* Broad modified - allows misspellings and order of words within search term can be different
* Phrase match - anything can come before or after search term but search term cannot be changed
* Exact match - must exactly match search term

Search term reports basically show you new types of keywords that you want to extract, but they also allows you to go after negative keywords. A negative keyword could be something like the word free. You can use negative keywords to make sure that Google doesn't show your ad in the future to somebody who is not looking to buy.

## Display & YouTube Targeting Options

Display and YouTube offer more targeting options compared to Search. This also means that the potential for not getting results is higher.

### Exploring different targeting options

You always want to startoff by creating a remarketing campaign. Once you create your own remarketing list, Google will automatically create similar audiences. Similar audiences, basically, mirror the demographics, interests and behaviours of your remarketing audience.

Then you have demographics, keywords, topics and placements. These options all add more layers on top of your targeting - which restricts the targeting. You should set up separate ad groups that each only have one layer of these targeting options applied so that you can see how they perform individually.

## The Main Dashboard

This is where you’ll be spending most of your time. The main dashboard is where all the analytics, data, and optimization routines occur.

## Campaign Build

Your campaign settings set the overall momentum potential and reach of your campaigns.

This is where you select:

## Ad Group Builds

Your ad groups house your targeting and ad creative. The way that you set these up are crucial to your success – and it all comes back to the principle of granularity.

## Filters, Scripts, Rules & Software

Before you start making adjustments to your campaigns and ad groups, it’s smart to have some safety nets that help you catch issues and help you make changes with ease. You can:

* Use filters to bulk changes to faster optimization
* Use scripts to automate account changes
* Use rules to alert you of anomalies
* Take your Google Account to new heights with software

## Optimisation Routines

To simplify and prioritise your manual changes in your Google Ads account, it’s important you know which things matter most and which things don’t. Optimisation routines help you:

* Perform multi ad group ad testing & ad testing significance so you can determine a winner and a loser from an ad perspective.
* Know how to add negative keywords & create new ad groups
* See which placements you Display and YouTube campaigns are gathering
* Know how to make bid adjustments at they keyword, audience, and ad group levels
